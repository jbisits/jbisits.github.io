I began to learn the double bass when I was fourteen with Paul Laszlo.
Soon after starting I joined the Hunter strings ensemble.
In 2005 I took part in the Young Symphonists program with the Australian Youth Orchestra (AYO).
In 2006 I attended the AYO national music camp and joined the Sydney Youth Orchestra with whom I appeared as a soloist in December 2006.

In 2007 I moved to Sydney to study at the Sydney Conservatorium with Alex Henery.
During this year I played with the Australian Youth Orchestra and continued with the Sydney Youth Orchestra.
The following year I joined the Sydney Sinfonia and in 2010 was a Sydney Symphony fellow whilst I was in the final year of my bachelor of music.
As a fellow I took part in many main stage performances with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra as well as chamber music performances in and around Sydney with the other fellows.

In 2011 I moved to London to take part in the Southbank Sinfonia orchestral training program.
This led to many performances in and around London at venues such as the Royal Festival Hall, Wigmore hall and Canterbury Cathedral.

Eventually I tired of the London drizzle so moved back to Sydney at the end of 2012 and in 2013 was an emerging artist with the Australian Chamber Orchestra.
As part of this program I got to see a lot of Australia through regional touring in New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, Western Australia and Tasmania.

From 2014 till the present I have been a freelance double bass player working with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, Australian Chamber Orchestra and Opera Australia.
Some musical highlights from this period have been [Beethoven's fifth symphony with the Australina Chamber Orchestra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKFLH-y6Ao0), *The Marriage of Figaro* with Opera Australia and *Beethoven's sixth symphony* with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra.

In 2019 I was part of an adaption of the children's book [There is a Sea in my Bedroom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGKj2V3CTs) where I even did some acting!!

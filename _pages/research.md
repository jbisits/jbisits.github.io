My area of research is physical oceanography.
I am very interested in mixing processes and how they can control the structure of water masses as well as transport tracers (like heat and carbon) around the ocean.

## Non-linear controls on water masses

This is the first project of my PhD.

## Isopycnal mixing

Talk about honours thesis and paper.

## Water quality

Maybe put this?

## Software

I use [Julia](https://julialang.org/) as it is excellent for scientific computing.
I am currently involved in the development of [PassiveTracerFlows.jl](https://fourierflows.github.io/PassiveTracerFlowsDocumentation/stable/).

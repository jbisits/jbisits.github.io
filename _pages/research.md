My area of research is physical oceanography.
The focus of my PhD are the *Non-linear controls on ocean circulation and mixing in the marginal ice zone*.
The non-linear equation of state for the density of seawater leads to interesting phenomena, such as a gain in density when two water masses of equal density, but differing temperature and salinity, are mixed.
Though these non-linear processes are not leading order, the may be placing controls on water mass transformation in the Southern Ocean.

## Non-linear controls on water masses

This is the first project of my PhD.
We are investigating whether a non-linear process called [*cabbeling*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabbeling) may be a rate limiting process on the overturning of water columns in the Southern Ocean.
The Antarctic winter causes the surface water to approach its freezing point.
If brine rejection occurs due to sea ice formation, then the density of the winter surface water increases.
Once the salinity of the surface water reaches a critical value, relatively warm and salty deep water that is upwelled to the surface can mix with this winter surface water resulting in a more dense water mass forming (as a result of cabbeling) that can trigger a gravitational instability and convection.
We are trying to track the behaviour of vertical profiles using model output and in-situ observations to see if this cabbeling instability can be diagnosed.

## Isopycnal mixing

Another area I have interest in is isopycnal mixing (mixing along surfaces of constant density).
Isopycnal mixing in the Southern Ocean is important for the global climate as it influences the uptake and transport of heat and carbon.
We have explored estimating isopycnal mixing based on the spreading of passive tracer release experiments and how reliable an estimate can be made based on the spreading of a single tracer release experiment as is usually the case for observational campaigns.

## Water quality modelling and prediction

As a research assistant I worked with [Associate Lecturer Simon Llyod](https://www.unsw.edu.au/staff/simon-lloyd) on processing and analysing data that was used to develop the [RiverWatch model](https://urbanplunge.sydneywater.com.au/content/dam/sydneywater/urban-plunge/documents/Riverwatch%20Predictive%20Model%20fact%20sheet_online.pdf).
This model is a predictive water quality model used to predict the amount of pollution, and consequently whether water is safe to swim in.

## Software

![image-left](/assets/images/Julia_Programming_Language_Logo.svg){: .align-left style="width: 20%;"} I use the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/) as it is excellent for scientific computing, open source and has a great community (Image from the [Julia wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_(programming_language))).
I am currently involved in the development of [PassiveTracerFlows.jl](https://fourierflows.github.io/PassiveTracerFlowsDocumentation/stable/) and the owner and maintainer of the package [OceanRasterConversions.jl](https://jbisits.github.io/OceanRasterConversions.jl/dev/).

![image-left](/assets/images/Julia_Programming_Language_Logo.svg){: .align-left style="width: 20%;"} I use the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/) as it is excellent for scientific computing, open source and has a great community (Image from the [Julia wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_(programming_language))).
I am currently involved in the development of [PassiveTracerFlows.jl](https://fourierflows.github.io/PassiveTracerFlowsDocumentation/stable/) and the owner and maintainer of the packages: [TwoLayerDirectNumericalShenanigans.jl](https://github.com/jbisits/TwoLayerDirectNumericalShenanigans.jl), [RasterHistograms.jl](https://github.com/jbisits/RasterHistograms.jl) and [OceanRasterConversions.jl](https://jbisits.github.io/OceanRasterConversions.jl/dev/).

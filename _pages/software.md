I use the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/) as it is excellent for scientific computing, open source and has a great community.
I am the owner and maintainer of the packages: [StaircaseShenanigans.jl](https://github.com/jbisits/StaircaseShenanigans.jl), [TwoLayerDirectNumericalShenanigans.jl](https://github.com/jbisits/TwoLayerDirectNumericalShenanigans.jl), [RasterHistograms.jl](https://github.com/jbisits/RasterHistograms.jl) and [OceanRasterConversions.jl](https://jbisits.github.io/OceanRasterConversions.jl/dev/).
I am currently involved in the development of [PassiveTracerFlows.jl](https://fourierflows.github.io/PassiveTracerFlowsDocumentation/stable/) and have contributed to several other packages including [FourierFlows.jl](https://github.com/FourierFlows/FourierFlows.jl), [GeophysicalFlows.jl](https://github.com/FourierFlows/GeophysicalFlows.jl) and [Oceananigans.jl](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl).

I am also fluent with [R](https://www.r-project.org/), [python](https://www.python.org/), [MATLAB/Octave](https://octave.org/), [$\LaTeX$](https://www.latex-project.org/) and [git](https://git-scm.com/).

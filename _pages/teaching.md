I have been actively involved in teaching throughout my music and mathematics/oceanography career.
Teaching is something I enjoy as I am always trying to think of ways to better explain things to myself and others!

## Mathematics

I have been tutoring in the [School of Mathematics and Statistics](https://www.unsw.edu.au/science/our-schools/maths) at the University of New South Wales since 2021.
The courses I have tutored are:

- Mathematics 1A (MATH1131)
- Mathematics 1B (MATH1231/1241)
- Numerical methods and statistics (MATH2089)
- Fluids, Oceans, and Climate (MATH3261-5285)
- Mathematics drop in centre

## Music

I have taught double bass privately to several students, one of whom successfully auditioned for the Australian Youth Orchestras [Young Symphonists](https://ayo.com.au/program/young-symphonists/) program.
I also tutored several ensembles and double bass sections in the [Sydney Youth Orchestras](https://syo.com.au/) including the Peter Seymour Orchestra.

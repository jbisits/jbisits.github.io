## Brief bio

I grew up in Newcastle, NSW.
I started playing the double bass at age 14 and, largely due to a wonderful teacher named Paul Laszlo, it quickly became the only thing I was really interested in.
I moved to Sydney in 2007 to study double bass at the Sydney conservatorium.
In 2010 I was a [Sydney Symphony fellow](https://www.sydneysymphony.com/learning/sydney-symphony-fellowship).
In 2011 I moved to London to take part in the [Southbank Sinfonia](https://www.southbanksinfonia.co.uk/) orchestral training program.
I lived and worked as a freelance double bassist in London until the end of 2012 when I moved back to Sydney.
In 2013 I was an [emerging artist](https://www.aco.com.au/learning-and-engagement/talent-development-programs/emerging-artists-program) with the [Australian Chamber Orchestra](https://www.aco.com.au/).
Since 2013 I have been a regular guest musician with the Sydney symphony orchestra, the Australian chamber orchestra and the [Opera Australia Orchestra](https://opera.org.au/).

As much as I loved music and playing the double bass I did retain some other interests.
One of these was literature, mainly due to a David Foster Wallace obsession.
This obsession also led to me rediscover my enjoyment of mathematics due to his book [Everything and more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_and_More_(book)).
This rediscovery led me back to university in the second half of 2016 to begin a bachelor of science with a major in mathematics.
When I started I was not really sure where it would take me, I just enjoyed the maths and the mental stimulation that studying brings!
I was lucky to have great supervisors ([Associate Professor Jan Zika](https://sites.google.com/view/janzika/home) and [Dr Geoff Stanley](https://geoffstanley.github.io/)) for my honours project one of whom even took me on to do a PhD!

Currenlty I am in the second year of my PhD and continuing to work as a freelance double bassist.
In my spare time I play and watch lots of tennis, read and spend time with my family.

I am a PhD candidate and professional double bassist living in Syndey, Australia.
In 2010 I completed a bachelor of music (performance) at the Sydney Conservatorium and have been working as a professional double bassist since 2008.
In 2021 I completed a bachelor of science (honours) in applied mathematics at the university of New South Wales.
In 2022 I started my PhD, again at the university of New South Wales in applied mathematics, under the supervision of Associate Professor Jan Zika.



My area of research is water mass transformation where we look at how the density of seawater changes as a result of changes in temperature and/or salinity.
The way the Southern Ocean absorbs and redistributes things like heat and carbon is influenced by water mass transformation which makes it important for the climate as a whole.



My work as a double bassist is with the opera Australia orchestra, Sydney symphony orchestra and Australian chamber orchestra.



For fun I love to play tennis and spend time with my family.

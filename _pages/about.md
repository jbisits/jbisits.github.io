In 2010 I completed a bachelor of music (performance) at the Sydney Conservatorium and I have been working as a professional double bassist since 2008.
In 2021 I completed a bachelor of science (honours) in applied mathematics at the University of New South Wales.
In 2022 I started a PhD, again at the University of New South Wales in applied mathematics, under the supervision of Associate Professor Jan Zika.

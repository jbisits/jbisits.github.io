I am a PhD candidate and professional double bassist living in Syndey, Australia.
In 2010 I completed a bachelor of music (performance) at the Sydney Conservatorium and have been working as a professional double bassist since 2008.
In 2021 I completed a bachelor of science (honours) in applied mathematics at the university of New South Wales.
In 2022 I started my PhD, again at the university of New South Wales in applied mathematics, under the supervision of Associate Professor Jan Zika.
